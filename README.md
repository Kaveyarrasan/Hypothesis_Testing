# Project Description:
- **Trip Patterns and Trends:**  
Analyze trip data from 2018-09-12 to 2018-10-08, observing peak trips around 10 PM and a steady increase after noon, followed by a decline.

- **Time and Distance Discrepancies:**  
Investigate discrepancies between actual time and segment OSRM time, as well as differences between OSRM distance and segment OSRM distance, which are statistically significant.

- **Transportation Modes:**  
Evaluate transportation types, with FTL transportation accounting for 60.2% and carting transportation at 39.8% of total trips.

- **Geographical Insights:**  
Focus on Maharashtra, which dominates the data as most orders originate and terminate within the state.

- **Optimization Opportunities:**  
Identify ways to improve delivery time predictions by addressing statistical differences between features like actual_time and OSRM_time, and enhancing the routing engine.

# Depth of Analysis and Profit Opportunities:
- **Peak Hour Optimization:**  
Understanding peak trip times (e.g., 10 PM) allows resource allocation and workforce management during high-demand hours, improving efficiency and customer satisfaction, leading to higher profits.

- **Time and Distance Accuracy:**  
Addressing discrepancies between actual time and OSRM time and optimizing routing can reduce delays, enhance delivery predictability, and minimize operational costs, boosting profitability.

- **Transportation Mode Insights:**  
Analyzing the dominance of FTL transportation (60.2%) offers an opportunity to optimize fleet utilization, potentially shifting some loads to carting transportation where feasible to reduce costs and maximize vehicle usage.

- **Regional Focus on Maharashtra:**  
Leveraging the high volume of orders within Maharashtra, targeted strategies (e.g., localized marketing, warehouse expansion) can capitalize on this market, driving increased revenues.
